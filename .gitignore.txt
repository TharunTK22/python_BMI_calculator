This is a very important file that tells Git which files or folders it should ignore. You don't want to upload user data, Python's temporary cache files, or system-specific files to your repository.

Create a file named .gitignore (make sure it starts with a period) and add the following content:

Plaintext

# Python cache
__pycache__/

# User-generated data file
bmi_data.csv

# Virtual Environment folders
venv/
.venv/
env/
.env/

# System-specific files (macOS and Windows)
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
Adding these files to your project folder before you run git add . and git commit is a great habit to get into!
