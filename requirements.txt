This file lists the Python libraries that your project needs to run. Someone can easily install all of them using the command pip install -r requirements.txt.

For the advanced version of the BMI calculator, this file should contain:

Plaintext

pandas
matplotlib
(Note: The beginner version does not require any external libraries, so this file would be empty for that version.)



Required Libraries: Open your terminal or command prompt and install the libraries the script needs:

pip install pandas matplotlib
